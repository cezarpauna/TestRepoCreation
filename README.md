## Menu
- **Espresso**: A strong coffee brewed by forcing hot water through finely-ground coffee beans.
- **Latte**: A creamy blend of espresso and steamed milk, topped with a light froth.
- **Cappuccino**: Similar to a latte, but with a thicker layer of froth on top for extra richness.
- **Cold Brew**: A smooth and refreshing coffee brewed with cold water for a longer duration.
- **Pastries**: A selection of fresh pastries to enjoy alongside your coffee.
